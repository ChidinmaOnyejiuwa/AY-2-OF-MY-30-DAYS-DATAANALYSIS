# Data Sourcing
Data source was from the John Hopkins Hospital Covid-19 dataset file:
CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series

# Steps Taken and Cleaning
STEP 1: ON the CSSEGISandData of John Hopkins Hospital i choosed the covid_19_time_series file and open it to get more datasets for my work.
        the first data i choose was the global confirmed case of covid_19. I choose the raw file instead of downloading it since i wanrt to work on a live field /daily           update file. 
STEP 2: I copied the Url address and open my Excel worksheet. In EWxcel click on New Query and then from source click on from web, then input the URL address into the           box provided and laod it into the Power Query. Transform the data first so the cleaning and other processes can be done in the Power Query,
STEP 3: I made changes to my Confirm dataset such as 
A) changing the header column
B) Changing the data types 
C) My data was a WIDE DATA(many columns than rows) to change this i highlighte the first 4 colums i had and right click a chose "unpivot other columns" this shorten the 
colums
